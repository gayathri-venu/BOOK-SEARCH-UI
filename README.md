# BOOK-SEARCH-UI
Building a book search UI using vue.js and reactivesearch.


  The purpose of the project is to build a search engine UI for a personal
database of books using elasticsearch and vue.js. The search engine developed
works on a given database of books and performs searches based on title, author
name etc. Books can also be filtered based on their ratings. It then neatly displays
the book searched for with its cover, author name, title and rating (all of which
are obtained from the database) as cards. Upon clicking the book card, it redirects
you to its Google page.
